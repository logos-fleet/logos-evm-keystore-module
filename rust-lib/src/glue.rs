//! Logos module glue for `keystore_module` (rust-first authoring).
//!
//! This file is the contract: the builder derives the `.lidl` from the
//! `KeystoreModule` trait below (`codegen.rust = { trait, source: "src/glue.rs" }`)
//! and injects the generated scaffold at the `include!` point. It is compiled
//! only with the default `logos_module` feature; `cargo test --no-default-features`
//! excludes it so the crypto core (`crate::keystore`) stays testable without the
//! generated scaffold or the Logos runtime.
//!
//! Every structured value crosses the IPC boundary as a JSON string. Methods
//! return `{ "ok": true, ... }` or `{ "ok": false, "error": "..." }`.
