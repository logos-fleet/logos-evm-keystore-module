//! Keystore core — pure, offline Ethereum key management and signing.
//!
//! No network, no Logos dependencies; this module is unit-testable on its own
//! (`cargo test`). Private keys live only inside a `Keystore`: on disk as
//! scrypt-encrypted JSON vaults (eth-keystore / Web3 Secure Storage), and in
//! memory only while an account is unlocked. Nothing here ever returns a raw
//! private key across its API — only addresses, signed payloads, and
//! (re-encrypted) vault JSON.
